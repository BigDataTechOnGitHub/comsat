## Getting started

In Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>COMSAT-SUBPROJECT-NAME</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, build from sources by running:

## Usage

* [Documentation](http://puniverse.github.io/comsat/)
* [Javadoc](http://puniverse.github.io/comsat/javadoc)

You can also study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar/tree/master/quasar-actors/src/test/java/co/paralleluniverse/actors).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

When running code that uses Quasar, the instrumentation agent must be run by adding this to the `java` command line:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```
