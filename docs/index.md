Quasar is a Java library that provides high-performance lightweight threads, Go-like channels, Erlang-like actors, and other asynchronous programming tools.

A good introduction to Quasar can be found in the blog post [Erlang (and Go) in Clojure (and Java), Lightweight Threads, Channels and Actors for the JVM](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).
